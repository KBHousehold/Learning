      <p>It was intensely enlightening to go through the research, layout and design phases for this project.  Phases were morphing often as I researched the various themes and subjects.  I was searching for a theme that would keep me interested to the end of this project.  I would assume that in an employed position, these phases would be more defined at the front end with lots of organizational needs given and end results defined or dictated; of which, at this stage of my life, might have created a less desire to challenge this project. </p>

      <p>At 83 years of age and retired, I still have a zest for knowledge and travel, albeit that I wish to remain in North America. I have enjoyed traveling through the various stages of my life even though some earlier travel experiences were dictated by family circumstances (single Mother seeking family support after my father died), a seven-year enlistment in the Navy (West Pacific), and using the highways of my choice and time, such as riding a Harley from sea to sea (East coast to West Coast) and other fun trips to various National Heritage sites in these United States.  I have an outline (bucket list) of a final motorhome trip planned soon to visit some unseen National Parks and Memorials starting in Tennessee… heading to the northwest, then to Utah, and on to Arkansas to see my paternal side of the family… then, back to Tennessee.  Along the way, just to make it more interesting, I be spending most nights in various wineries and farms booked through <a href="https://www.harvesthosts.com/" style="color: green">Harvest Hosts™</a> RV Camping, mostly, of course, for the food. &#128540;</p><br>
              
      <p>While researching what images and internet content is available to present; I found this list of sites that are considered important to the United States natural and cultural heritage. The National Park Service is the federal department managing the 431 different parks, monuments, battlefields and various other designated sites, including the White House and President’s Park. I’ve visited 57 of the sites listed on their presentation, I need to travel and see more.<p>
