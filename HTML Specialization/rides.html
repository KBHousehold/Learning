            <p>My sailboat ride was much like a motorhome with similar traveling amenities. I enjoy the open vista, no matter the time of day or changing weather, while navigating the wind sailing from Tampa Bay to the Dry Tortugas.  Weather south was great; sunny days with good winds and nights calm with a bright moon.  Homebound, different story; nice morning leaving port, then clouds began to darken, wind picked-up, and finally the weather turned into tropical storm conditions (heavy winds, heavy rains and heavy waves).  I was forced to reduce sails, start the auxiliary diesel engine and head into the storm, where ever the weather conditions took me; it was still very exciting.  I've experienced stronger Typhoons on the Pacific Ocean, but the "ride" was an Essex-class attack aircraft carrier <a href="https://www.seaforces.org/usnships/cv/CV-31-USS-Bon-Homme-Richard.htm" style="color: green">USS Bon Homme Richard CVA 31</a>, a "ship" that was 872' long, 28,000 tons and 93' at the beam with 8 steam boilers for propulsion.

          <p>If you want the ultimate commune with nature, this ride is the choice.  You'll experience all mother nature can give you, on her terms, not your plan.  Wardrobe is limited... but plenty of great shops to modify the "closet" on the route.  Interestingly, this mode of travel has given me the greatest access to most of the parks and momuments visited.  The Heartland states are Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin; the Eastern states remaining east of the Mississippi.  I have flown and rented Harley's out west as well; quess you would say I'm hooked on this ride for it's openness with Mother Nature and it's flexabilty for venue.

          <p>My USA travel plans have included planes, cars, motels, hotels, B&Bs and resorts; but, this travel vehicle combo has given me the best experience going to, staying at, shopping and departing from most of the visited sites.  All the other non-site options are available, but this is a comfortable ride to, with comfortable evenings at, usually, the site location.</p>
